## Improoving LLMs with Evals

```
pnpm eval <name of the file>
```

Example for `evals/experiments/reddit.eval.ts`

```
pnpm eval "reddit"
```

In real World we wouldn't build them ourself, we would use tool like [braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/) which is very expensive by the way. But it is used by major companies.
